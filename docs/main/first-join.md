Thank you for adding the bot to your server!

In order for the AnkeCore bot to work properly, the following steps need to be performed:

* Use the `/settings poll-channel` command to set the channel to which polls from users will be sent.
* Make sure that an automatic role is created for the bot that contains administrator privileges.
* All bot commands can be found via the **`/help`** command, or on our website https://ankecore.xyz/commands


> ðŸ’¡ Suggestions for improving the bot can be sent to us via the **/suggest** command or via our support discord server.
