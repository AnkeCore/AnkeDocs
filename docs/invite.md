# 🔗 Invite
Do you also want to have AnkeCore Bot on your discord server? 😍 Connecting a bot to your discord is very easy, you have the following options to choose from:

## Connecting via discord app&#x20;

1. Search for "AnkeCore" in the user list. 
2. In the list of users, click on "AnkeCore" and then click on the "Add to server" button
3. This will open a window in which we choose which server we want to connect the bot to.
4. After selecting the server, click continue. We don't change anything in this window, just make sure the **Administrator** checkbox is checked. Without this permission AnkeCore will not work properly, it will not be able to create polls, manage messages and so on... This is a verified bot, so you don't have to worry about your server 😉
5. Click the Authorize button and you're done. AnkeCore is connected to your server. You can start using AnkeCore Bot to its full potential! 😍

## Connecting via browser

1. We click on this [**discord link**](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=502848881415946240\&permissions=8\&scope=bot%20applications.commands), which redirects us to the discord site.
2. If we are not logged in, the discord will prompt us for a login.
3. After successfully logging in, we will be taken to a page where we select the server we want to connect the bot to from a list.
4. After selecting the server, click continue. We don't change anything in this window, just make sure the Administrator checkbox is checked. Without this permission AnkeCore will not work properly, it will not be able to create polls, manage messages and so on... This is a verified bot, so you don't have to worry about your server 😉
5. Click the Authorize button and you're done. AnkeCore is connected to your server. You can start using AnkeCore Bot to its full potential! 😍
